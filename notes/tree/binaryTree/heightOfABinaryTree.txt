Height of a binary tree = 1 + greater(leftHeight, rightHeight)

Follow same process to find the height of all subtrees

Base Case:
  Height of empty tree is 0

int height(struct Node *p) {
  int leftHeight, rightHeight;

  if (p == NULL) {
    return 0;
  }

  leftHeight = height(p->left);
  rightHeight = height(p->right);

  if (leftHeight > rightHeight) {
    return 1 + leftHeight;
  }

  else {
    return 1 + rightHeight;
  }
}
