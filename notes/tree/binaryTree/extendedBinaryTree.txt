Each empty subtree in a binary tree is replaced by a special node then the resulting tree is extended binary tree.

The nodes from original tree are internal nodes and the special nodes are external nodes

All external nodes are leaf nodes and all internal nodes are non-leaf nodes

Every internal nodes has exactly two children and every external node is a leaf node 

Path length of a node:
    Number of edges traversed from that node to the root node.
    It is the level number of that node.

Internal path length of a binary tree:
    Sum of path lengths of all internal nodes

External path length of a binary tree:
    Sum of path lengths of all external nodes
