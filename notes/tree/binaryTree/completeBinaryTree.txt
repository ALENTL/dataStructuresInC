All levels have maximum number of nodes except possible the last level

In the last level, number of nodes ranges from 1 to 2^(h-1) and all these nodes are towards the left

Height of a complete binary tree = ceil(log2(n+1))

If a node in a complete binary tree is assigned a number k,
  where 1 <= k <= n, then,
    if k == 1,
      then this node is root node

    if k > 1,
      then its parent node's number is floor(k/2)

    if 2k > n,
      then the current node has no left child
    else,
      the current node's left child's number is 2k

    if 2k + 1 > n,
      then the current node has no right child
    else,
      the current node's right child's number is 2k + 1
