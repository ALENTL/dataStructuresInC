Visiting the root node: N
Traversing its left subtree: L
Traversing its right subtree: R

Traversal in Binary Tree is usually three types:
  -> Preorder : NLR
  -> Inorder  : LNR
  -> Postorder: LRN

Preorder Traversal:
  => Visit the root (N)
  => Traverse the left subtree of the root in preorder (L)
  => Traverse the right subtree of the root in preorder (R)

Inorder Traversal:
  => Traverse the left subtree of the root in inorder (L)
  => Visit the root (N)
  => Traverse the right subtree of the root inorder (R)

Postorder Traversal:
  => Traverse the left subtree of the root in postorder (L)
  => Traverse the right subtree of the root in postorder (R)
  => Visit the root (N)

Level Order Traversal:
  Nodes are traversed level by level
