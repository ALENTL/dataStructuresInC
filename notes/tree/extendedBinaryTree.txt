Each empty subtree in a binary tree is replaced by a special node then the resulting tree is extended binary tree.

Path length of a node:
    Number of edges traversed from that node to the root node.
    It is the level number of that node.

Internal path length of a binary tree:
    Sum of path lengths of all internal nodes

External path length of a binary tree:
    Sum of path lengths of all external nodes
