Stored in 1-D array

Node numbered k
Data is stored in tree[k]

If not complete binary tree, we make it complete binary tree and assign the node numbers. For external nodes we don't store value in tree[k], we only set values for internal nodes.

Root node is usually stored at index 1.

When node is k,
  => Left child: 2k
  => Right child: 2k + 1
  => Parent = floor(k/2)

Size of array = h, where
  h = height of the tree with maximum number of nodes possible
