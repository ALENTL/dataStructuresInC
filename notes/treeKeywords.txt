1. Node:
    Each element of a tree is a node

2. Edge:
    Lines connecting the nodes

3. Parent Node:
    Immediate predecessor of a node

4. Child Node:
    Immediate successor of a node

5. Root Node:
    Specially designated node that does not have any parent

6. Leaf Node:
    Node that does not have any child.

7. Level:
    Distance of that node from the root

8. Height:
    Total number of levels of a tree

9. Siblings:
    Two or more nodes which have same parent

10. Path:
    Sequence of nodes N1, N2, ..., Nx such that each Node Ni is parent of Ni+1 for i = [1, x]

11. Ancestor:
    Node Na is an ancestor node of Nx if Na lies in the unique path from root node to Nx.

12. Descendent:
    If node Na is ancestor node of Nx, then the node Nx is descendent of node Na.

13. Subtree:
    A tree inside a tree

14. Degree:
    The number of subtrees or children of a node

15. Forest:
    Set of n disjoint trees where n >= 0
