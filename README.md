## LINKED LIST

### 1. Single Linked List
- create a linked list
- inserting first element to linked list
- inserting more elements to the end list
- display the list
- Count the number of nodes in the list
- Search for an element in the list and returns its position
- Search for a position in the list and returns the value at that position
- Insert a node after a given node
- Insert a node before a node
- Insert a node at given position
- Delete a node from the first position
- Delete a node in between nodes
- Delete a node at the end
- Reverse the list

### 2. Sorting of Single Linked List
- Sort by exchanging data
- Sort by exchanging nodal links

### 3. Merge two sorted lists
- Merging by creating a new list
- Merging by rearranging links

### 4. Sorting a List using Merge Sort Algorithm
- Using recursion to sort a linked list using merge sort algorithm

### 5. Solving a Cycle List
- Solving a list having cycle with Floyd's cycle detection algorithm
  - Inserting a cycle
  - Find the cycle
  - Removing the cycle

### 6. Doubly Linked List
- Linked list consisting of prev and next pointers and a data for each node
  - Create a doubly linked list
  - Insert at empty doubly linked list
  - Insert in the beginning of the doubly linked list
  - Insert at the end of the list
  - Insertion in between nodes
    - Insert after a node
    - Insert before a node
  - Deletion from doubly linked list
    - Deletion of the first node
    - Deletion of the only node
    - Deletion in between nodes
    - Deletion in last node
